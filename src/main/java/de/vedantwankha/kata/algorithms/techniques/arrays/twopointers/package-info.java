/**
 * <h1>Two Pointers Technique</h1>
 * <ul>
 * <li>General version of Sliding Window</li>
 * <li>Pointers can cross each other</li>
 * <li>Pointers can go different ways</li>
 * <li>Pointers can iterate over different arrays as well</li>
 * <li>Use for searching, sorting, finding pairs or subsequences satisfying certain conditions</li>
 * <li>Works better when the array is sorted or has some specific order that can determine how to move the pointer (eg. binary search, two sum etc)</li>
 * </ul>
