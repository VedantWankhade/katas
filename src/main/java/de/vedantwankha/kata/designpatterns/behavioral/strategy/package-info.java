/**
 * <p><b>Strategy</b> is a behavioral design pattern that lets us define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.</p>
 * <p><b>Example Implementation</b></p>
 *
 * <p>Say you are building a map application. The initial version only has a feature to show walking path, then next version has driving path
 * the next has cycle path etc.
