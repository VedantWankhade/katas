/**
 * <p><b>Observer</b> is a behavioral design pattern that lets us define a subscription mechanism to notify mutiple objects about any event thatn occur(usually to the object they are observing).</p>
 * <p><b>Example Implementation</b></p>
 *
 * <p>Say you have built a cloud file storage service where people can share files and folders.</p>
 * <p>Now you want to build a feature where users can be notified when there are changes to the file system
 * </p>
 * <p>Users should be able to subscribe to different events like file deletion, creation etc</p>
 * <p>Not only users but other external system can also subscribe</p>
