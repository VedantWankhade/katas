/**
 * <p><b>Singleton</b> is a creational pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance (while providing global access point to it)</p>
 * <p><b>Example Implementation</b></p>
 *
 * <p>Say you are building a map application.
 *  And given coordinates, you have to show the image of that place.
 *  Initially you were using googles api, but now you want to switch to bing.
 *...................
 *  But the bing api is a bit different, it needs the coordinates as y, x while google needs as x, y
