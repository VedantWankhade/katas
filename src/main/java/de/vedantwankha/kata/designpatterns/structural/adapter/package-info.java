/**
 * <p><b>Adapter</b> is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.</p>
 * <p><b>Example Implementation</b></p>
 *
 * <p>Say you are building a map application.
 *  And given coordinates, you have to show the image of that place.
 *  Initially you were using googles api, but now you want to switch to bing.
 *
 *  But the bing api is a bit different, it needs the coordinates as y, x while google needs as x, y
